# Space Apps 2026 project

## When to use
Any Space Apps 2026 build. Enforces offline-first caching, cited data, an OSI license, no under-18 likeness, and AI-use disclosure.

## Steps
1. Create the repo with LICENSE (Apache-2.0), README, cache/, demo_fixtures/, src/{acquire,compute,agents,api}, web/, docs/AI_USE.md.
2. Wire data through the nasa-data-access skill. Write every response to cache/.
3. Keep deterministic science in src/compute. Agents orchestrate and explain only.
4. Before the demo, run with OFFLINE=1 and record a 240-second video.
5. Fill the NASA project page using the judging-ready-submission skill.

## Guardrails
- Cite every dataset with an id and a URL.
- Name every AI tool used and record the prompts in docs/AI_USE.md.
- The repository must be public and openly licensed.
- Use hyphens only. No m-dashes or en-dashes anywhere in the repository.
